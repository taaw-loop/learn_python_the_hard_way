#Using PEMDAS as PE(M,D&%)(A&S)

print("I will now count my chickerns") # Prints the texts within the ("").

print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6) # 30 is divided by 6 then 5 is the result and is added to 25 equaling 30. 
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4) # 25 is multiplied by 3 equaling 75, then 75 is divided by 4 resulting in 18.75,4 multiplied by 18 is 72. The modulo operator gives the remander of how many times 4 goes into 75, which is 3 (75-72) then 3 is subtracted from 100 equaling 97.

print("Now I will count the eggs:") # Prints the texts within the ("") 

print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6) # The modulo operator is done first and is 0 than 1 is divided by 4 resulinting in .25, then addition and subtraction is done left to right resulting in 6.75

print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?") # Prints the texts within the ("")

print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7) # This evaluates the boolean expression and prints True or False. This is False because 5 is greater than 2.

print("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2) # Prints the texts within the ("") then prints the answer to 3 + 2.
print("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7) # Prints the texts within the ("") then prints the answer to 5 - 7.

print("Oh, that's why it's False.") # Prints the texts within the ("").

print("How about some more.") # Prints the texts within the ("").

print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2) # Prints the texts within the ("") then gives evaluates the boolean expression and prints True or False. 5 > -2 is True
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2) # Prints the texts within the ("") then gives evaluates the boolean expression and prints True or False. 5 >= -2 is True
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2) # Prints the texts within the ("") then gives evaluates the boolean expression and prints True or False. 5 > -2 is True

print("Is it true that 71 < 80 - 3?") # Prints the texts within the ("")

print(71 < 80 - 3) # This evaluates the boolean expression and prints True or False. 71 < 80 - 3 is True.
